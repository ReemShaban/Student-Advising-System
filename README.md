## Student Advising System (A group Project)

A C++ console application that facilitates the time-consuming advising process. Not only does this program allow for easy course registration and visualization of courses dependency trees but based on a prior knowledge of the students records, it can identify available courses and personalize a recommended combination that will best suit that student as well.
