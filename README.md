## Student Advising System 
<p> <em>A group project</em> </p>

A C++ console application that facilitates the time-consuming advising process. Not only does this program allow for easy course registration and visualization of courses dependency trees but based on a prior knowledge of the students records, it can identify available courses and personalize a recommended combination that will best suit that student as well.
